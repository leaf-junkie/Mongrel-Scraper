###Future additions
There's always more work to be done! I plan on adding more functionality regarding the notes, making it a full CRUD operation. Users can create and update notes, but there currently is no option to delete a note. 

###Issues
The modal and notes are buggy. It seems that editing a note for one dog also edits the note for other dogs. I've yet to determine the reason, but I suspect it is the way I'm rendering a single modal with Handlebars.
